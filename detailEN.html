       <h2>Evening Primrose Coaching.</h2>
       <p>The evening primrose is a flexible plant that thrives in diverse environments. It often grows in full sun, although it can tolerate some shade. The flowers of the evening primrose have four sepals and are usually yellow. They bloom in the evening and at night—hence the name. The evening primrose is not only an attractive ornamental plant, but also a valuable source of medicinal oil and an important contributor to biodiversity.</p>
       <p>… Flexible, adaptable, a little different, valuable, healing …</p>
       <p>These are characteristics that also apply to my coaching.</p>

       <h3>My Perspective on the Human Being</h3>
       <p>My primary goal is to guide people in their personal development journey. I do so based on a specific view of the human being, which is central to my coaching practice and serves as my reference point as a coach. It forms the foundation of the professional relationship I build with my clients.</p>
       <p>I see the human being as a complex entity that must develop four main aspects of its existence in harmony—like the four petals of an evening primrose:</p>
           <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
               <li>Biological being</li>
               <li>Spiritual being</li>
               <li>Psychological (individual) being</li>
               <li>Social being</li>
           </ol>
       <p>Together, these aspects form the core of what it means to be human, and they influence our lives and choices in unique ways. Body and consciousness are intertwined within our ‘self’. This self is not divisible into a ‘body’ and a ‘consciousness’ but is constantly shaped by the world around us. To clarify this, I will refer to it in uppercase (SELF) below. Each of these four aspects plays a crucial role in the development of the SELF, and I believe that meeting the needs of each area leads to balanced growth.</p>
       <p>Human needs include biological factors such as oxygen, nutrition, and shelter; psychological needs like safety and autonomy; social needs such as relationships and reputation; and spiritual needs such as meaning and understanding one’s place in the world. How we fulfill these needs depends on the choices we make—based on our personal history—and it affects our further development.</p>
       <p>In my coaching practice, I integrate these fundamental principles to help clients grow, evolve, and achieve their personal and professional goals.</p>
<hr>
       <h3>Neo-Behaviorist Perspective</h3>
       <p>I adopt a neo-behaviorist perspective on the individual as a psychological being. This perspective describes how our behavior takes shape:</p>
           <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
               <li><b>Stimulus:</b> We respond to both external and internal stimuli through our senses, and to thoughts.</li>
               <li><b>Processing:</b> We process these stimuli through reflection (reason) or feeling (emotion and intuition), which leads to meaning-making.</li>
               <li><b>Response:</b> Our reactions to meaningful situations are the choices we make, based on our SELF at that moment. The nature of our responses may be extraverted or introverted, reflecting personal tendencies and traits. We may aim for control and management or for a live-and-let-live approach.</li>
           </ol>
<hr>
       <h3>Interaction and Society</h3>
       <p>Human beings do not live in isolation. We are part of a larger system, just as the evening primrose doesn’t produce a single flower but many, all growing on the same plant. I approach human collaboration and coexistence from a systems theory perspective. Our interactions with others, the material world, society, and our own identity form the context in which we live. We are all elements within a system, and human interaction is a continuous collaboration between all elements of that system.</p>
       <p>The <b>prisoner's dilemma</b> offers a successful strategy for constructive interaction with others. This strategy follows three steps:</p>
           <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li>When engaging with someone for the first time, always aim to cooperate (friendly behavior).</li>
               <li>If the other responds competitively, adjust your behavior accordingly (punishing behavior).</li>
               <li>As soon as the other person returns to cooperative behavior, respond likewise (forgiving behavior).</li>
           </ul>
       <p>In our pursuit of happiness, it is essential to act in a positive, constructive, solution-oriented, and balanced way. This contributes to our well-being and personal development. After all, we don’t live in isolation—we must cultivate constructive relationships. A third-party observer, such as a coach, can support us in improving how we build and maintain those relationships. Our well-being, personal growth, even the ecosystem we live in and our role in it all depend on these relationships. More often than not, when our behavior changes, our relationships change, and the system transforms.</p>
<hr>
       <h3>Choices and Identity</h3>
       <p>Our identity is shaped by the choices we make. In daily life, we often act on autopilot—we know what to do and how to behave. But when we face challenges or crises, we need to analyze the situation, reflect on possible actions and outcomes, and then choose between them. These choices define who we are and how we grow. Whether we respond to external stimuli through observation or to internal ones through introspection, our responses are meaningful choices that form our identity.</p>
       <p>Of course, we don’t make choices in a vacuum—we are shaped by our personal history and cultural environment, each of us in a particular place on this planet. Family, ethnicity, social class, gender, personal beliefs… all of this influences who we are. But we do have free will, and we can always choose differently.</p>
<hr>
       <h3>My Core Values</h3>
       <p>My coaching philosophy is rooted in a set of deep values. These values guide me as a person and, by extension, as a coach:</p>
           <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li><b>Reciprocity in relationships:</b> I believe in building mutually respectful relationships with my clients, based on open communication and trust.</li>
               <li><b>Self-reliance:</b> My goal is to enable clients to answer their life and career questions independently, to make their own decisions without constant support.</li>
               <li><b>Collaboration:</b> I believe in the power of cooperation and teamwork, as it fosters growth and development.</li>
               <li><b>Integrity:</b> Honesty and transparency are central to my coaching practice—they form the foundation for informed decisions and meaningful change.</li>
               <li><b>Wonder:</b> Nurturing a sense of wonder for life and the world supports growth and personal development.</li>
               <li><b>Respectful opposition:</b> I value diverse perspectives. They lead to innovation and growth, which is why I encourage clients to think critically and challenge themselves.</li>
           </ul>   
<hr>
       <h3>My Role as a Coach</h3>
        <p>As a coach, I strive to positively impact every human being I interact with—clients, colleagues, suppliers, and others. My ultimate goal is to contribute to others' development and support their self-reliance. I see myself as a guide and companion in the process of personal and professional growth.</p>
        <p>My preferred method is Socratic questioning, in a non-judgmental and non-manipulative way.</p>
        <p>I offer three coaching services, each tailored to a specific audience:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: disc;">
               <li>Leadership coaching for line managers or owner-managers of SMEs: I support professionals in leadership roles to make strategic decisions and reach career goals—e.g., the 45-year-old CEO of a medium-sized company struggling with work-life balance, or the 30-year-old startup founder dealing with rapidly growing responsibilities.</li>
               <li>Career discovery for both early-career and experienced individuals with career questions: I help people seeking (new) direction to find their own path—e.g., the 50-year-old whose children have left home and who’s wondering what to do in this new life phase.</li>
               <li>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) coaching for any professional facing DEI challenges: I believe in the power of diverse perspectives and experiences. Unfortunately, not everyone does. That’s why people sometimes need help creating a safe and respectful work environment—e.g., the 40-year-old production manager now tasked with managing growing tensions on the work floor.</li>
           </ul>
       <p>As a coach, I am fully committed to my clients. I will do everything I can to ensure high-quality coaching, focused on clearly defined goals. But I cannot override my clients’ free will. Their willingness, determination, and energy to grow and evolve are what drive the results.</p>
       <p>In my coaching, I consider the four anchors of life: personal situation, relationships, (educational) history, and the labor market. These elements all play a crucial role in my clients' lives and careers, and I help them find a healthy balance between them.</p>
       <p>I base my approach on scientifically validated methods and tools. This provides a strong foundation for coaching and enables my clients to make evidence-based decisions and develop effective strategies for personal and professional growth.</p>
        <p>I choose the evening primrose as a symbol of a beautiful being—where each of the four sepals is developed in harmony with the other three. And the evening primrose is never just one flower. It’s many, growing together on the same plant and encouraging each other to flourish. This symbolizes the pursuit of balance and growth in all aspects of human life. </p>
