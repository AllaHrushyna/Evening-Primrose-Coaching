        <h2>Evening Primrose Coaching</h2>

        <p>Leading is difficult, especially for people who have grown out of their area of expertise into a role where they are also responsible for a team.
        <p>On the one hand, your team members can focus more than you on new trends in their field of expertise, while you have to spend time leading the team. On the other hand, managing a team also requires expertise — but most of us haven't been trained for that.
        <p>What’s more, you stand alone within your team. You can’t share all information with your team members, and they don’t share everything with you either. So where do you find a sparring partner? Someone to brainstorm new ideas with, to get a second opinion on possible solutions — who can you turn to for that?
        <p>And then there are the pitfalls of leadership: taking over tasks your team members can’t handle, but that you happen to be very good at. Or: getting caught in the tension between your manager or board of directors on one side, and your team on the other. Increasingly diverse teams — with different generations, genders, backgrounds, cultures, etc. — only add to the complexity.
        <p>A good coach empowers you. You get support in determining your position within the team and the organization. Decisions become clearer, so you can actually make them. In this way, you grow in your role as a leader. Your confidence and expertise grow along with you.</p>
